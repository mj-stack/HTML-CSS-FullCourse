## About This Project

Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹  

I am currently learning web development and have started my journey with the frontend. As a part of my learning, I created this basic project: **A YouTube Clone**.  
This project is built entirely using **HTML** and **CSS** and aims to replicate the core design and layout of YouTube. Itâ€™s a simple yet exciting step in my web development journey! ðŸš€  

Feel free to check it out and share your feedback! ðŸ˜Š
